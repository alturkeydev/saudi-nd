#  كود اليوم_الوطني_السعودي_90  
- Please, note that I took it upon myself and made my solution using React.js with a few libraries because I found coding a solution in Java or Python on a CLI to be boring.
- I hope that does not disqualify me.

# Requirments
- I followed the reuiqrements provided. Users are requested for two inputs. The Gerogian day and month of the Saudi National Day. If entered correctly, the string "اليوم الوطني السعودي" in addition to the number count of the day.
